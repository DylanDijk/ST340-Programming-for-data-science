# R Markdown

An R Markdown document is a combination of formatted text, \LaTeX $\,$equations, and R code. This can be a useful tool for presenting a statistical analysis, since the source code and output can be interleaved with explanatory prose. In data science, this is known as *literate programming*[^1]. An R Markdown document (`.Rmd` file) can be compiled to produce Adobe PDF, Microsoft Word, or hypertext (HTML) output. You will need to use R Markdown to complete your assignments, but you might also find it useful for your weekly computer laboratory.

[^1]: Knuth, Donald E. (1992). *[Literate Programming](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/lp.html)*.

Download `Lab0.Rmd` from the Moodle page and open it in RStudio. If you press the **Knit** button, you should be able to compile it into a PDF document.

![knitr](Data//knitr.png)\

To create a new R Markdown document, use the menu command File > New File > R Markdown... 

You should see a dialogue box similar to the following:

# R Programming Exercises

These math / programming problems are the first 7 Project Euler problems. There are many more at <http://projecteuler.net/>

\vspace{3cm}

## Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we
get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the
multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

```{r}
library(magrittr)

multiples_3_or_5 = vector(length = 999)

for(i in 1:999){
  multiples_3_or_5[i] = (i%%3 == 0 | i%%5 == 0)
}
 
c(1:999)[multiples_3_or_5] %>%
  sum() %>%
    print()



```

## Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous
two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5,
8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence
whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued
terms.

## Problem 3: Largest prime factor

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest prime
factor of the number $600851475143$?

## Problem 4: Largest palindrome product

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
from the product of two 2-digit numbers is $9009 = 91 \times 99$. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Hint: try "??strplit" to find an analogue of rev() for strings

## Problem 5: Smallest multiple

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1
to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number that is
evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

## Problem 6: Sum square difference

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is $1^2 + 2^2 + \dots + 10^2 = 385$. The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is $(1 + 2 + \dots + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025$. Hence the difference between the sum of the squares
of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is $3025 - 385 = 2640$.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred 
natural numbers and the square of the sum.

## Problem 7: 10001st prime

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see
that the 6th prime is 13. What is the 10 001st prime number?
